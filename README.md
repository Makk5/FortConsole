# FortConsole

Yes, this does work for the latest version of Fortnite, make sure you're compiling x64 and not x86 as that is the most common mistake.

No, this does not need to be updated every update, and the rare occurrences where it does, I will update it within 24 hours.

A DLL that creates the UE4 console.

Specifically made for the latest version of Fortnite, so may not work for other games.

Make sure to launch without anti-cheat to avoid being banned.

Any DLL injector should work if launched without anti-cheat.

CheatManager/FortCheatManager commands will not work (e.g.``toggledebugcamera``, ``summon``, ``destroyall``, ect).
Re-enabling them will be added in the future, infact, it's already done, but won't be pushed to this repo yet due to inefficient version flexibility (breaks on updates).

Be careful when using ``showdebug`` as it lags the game due to not being able to find a font.
